Statistical Tests
-----------------
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:
The KS test shows that the maximum difference between the cumulative distributions, D, is 0.84. For a sample size of 50 and level of significance of  0.05, the critical value is 0.192. This means that the two sets of data do not conform to the same normal distribution.
Therefore, the datasets are non-parametric.


– The results of statistical tests that compare the fitness results of your EA with a classmate’s EA. You should clearly
state if there is a statistically significant difference between the average, maximum and minimum fitness of your EA versus
your classmate’s EA.
– A working theory as to why there is (or is not) a statistically significant difference between the fitness results of the
two EAs (200 words maximum).

*Note: the results I gave to Dylan were from an old calculation, before implementing two types of crossovers and then finding the best children of these crossovers. Therefore, Dylan's conclusions and results will be different from mine.

Statistical Tests
-----------------
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:
The KS test shows that the maximum difference between the cumulative distributions, D, is 0.16. For a sample size of 50 and level of significance of  0.05, the critical value is 0.192. This means that the two sets of data conform to the same normal distribution because D<critical value.
Therefore, the datasets are parametric.

Welch's t-test:
The result of an excel t.test function with a one-tailed distribution and two-sample unequal variance is 0.3509. (=T.TEST(A1:A50;B1:B50;1;3)) In order to reject the null hypothesis, the result must be less than the level of significance (0.05 for 95% certainty or 0.01 for 99% certainty). The result is greater than the level of significance, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and so one must conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between the datasets.

Student's t-test:
Alternatively, using the t-test calculator at http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/t-test_bulk_form.html, the t-test gives a t-value of 0.375 with 98 degrees of freedom. The critical value for a result with up to 120 degrees of freedom and a level of significance of 0.001 is 3.37. The results are significant if the t-value is greater than the critical value. Since t-value<critical value, the same conclusion can be drawn that the results are not significantly different.

Dylan keeps the top 1.7% parents for the next generation. The other 98.3% is generated by repeatedly performing ordered crossover on 2 random parents from the top 1.7% of the parent population. Each child has a 50% chance of mutating using inversion.

I keep the top 2% of the population for the next generation. 80% of the next generation comes from creating children from the top 60% parents. The remaining 18% is new random chromosomes. For children: parents are selected using linear ranking with a selection pressure of 1.8. From two parents, two children are generated using Partial Mapped Crossover and two children are generated using Two Point Ordered Crossover. Each child has a 70% chance of mutation, which can include inversion, translocation, transposition, and shifting. The best two out of four children are taken to the next generation.

Both algorithms preserve a similar percentage of the parents for the next generation. Both algorithms perform crossover on a subset of the population, although Dylanâ€™s subset is far smaller than mine, which could have improved his results. This could be offset by my linear ranking, which weights better parents favourably, and multiple crossovers and mutations which can improve diversity.
